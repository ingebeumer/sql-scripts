                "Having said that, sometimes it can be useful to cleanup auto created statistics. Over time they were implicitly and quietly auto created to support the queries for the workload at that time, and may no longer be useful for the current workload as reports, software, business logic, and queries have changed. They may even have been created for test or troubleshooting queries that were issued once many years ago. Also you may have duplicate statistics as first it was auto created and later an index (with accompanying index statistic) was created. \n",
                "\n",
                "All these accumulated statistics are maintained in your statistics maintenance, which is an expensive process. Dropping them may cause a temporary performance degradation. It will place some temporary stress on the system as queries are run, Query Optimizer will detect missing statistics and will create them. However when running a representative workload, pretty soon all that are necessary are recreated and Query Optimizer and statistics maintenance only need to work with statistics used by current query patterns. All old and now unnecessary statistics ballast is gone.\n",
